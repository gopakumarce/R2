# What is R2 

R2 is a L3 packet router written in rust inspired by the design of VPP <https://fd.io>. It potentially 
will evolve into an L4/L7 proxy (yet another!)

NOTE: R2 compiles and works only on linux as of now, tested with Ubuntu 20.04, although it should work
with any later ubuntu also

## Getting familiar with R2

The recommended method is to first go through the general overview page <https://gopakumarce.github.io/R2/>, which has links with a high level overview of R2. And once that is done, go through the TryMe page <https://gopakumarce.github.io/R2/tryme/> and just get familiar with downloading the code, compiling it and getting R2 running with a simple two container setup. Once that is done you can refer to the code itself accompanied by the documentation in various modules of the code
