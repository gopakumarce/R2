# Usage

This just dumps the logs .. Usage is ./target/debug/r2log [optional filename] .. If no file name is provided, the logs are dumped to /tmp/r2_logs.json - note that as of today the individual thread's logs are dumped as /tmp/r2_logs.json:0 /tmp/r2_logs.json:1 etc.. Its a TBD to merge the logs into one file
